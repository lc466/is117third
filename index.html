    <!-- Card 1: Bauhaus -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Bauhaus</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1919–1933</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>The Bauhaus was a German school and design movement that integrated art, craft and industrial production, teaching students through the Vorkurs to study form, materials and color. Its visible language favors geometric abstraction, modularity, and functionalism: simplified planes, clear sans-serif typography, restrained palettes, and machine-friendly construction. Designers used grid system, typographic hierarchy, alignment and negative space to improve legibility and readability across posters, furniture and architecture. The school emphasized information design and reproducible methods—workshop prototypes became industrial products—shaping twentieth-century corporate identity, mass-produced furniture, and standard approaches to modern layout.</p>

    <!-- Card 2: Swiss Style -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>Swiss Style</h2>
      <p class="date-range">International Typographic Style · 1950s–1970s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>The International Typographic Style prioritized clarity and systematic visual order in print and identity work from the 1950s to the 1970s. Practitioners established rigorous grid system layouts that aligned photography + type integration with clear typographic hierarchy and generous negative space. Sans-serif typefaces and objective tone supported legibility and readability across posters, signage, and corporate identity programs. Alignment, consistent spacing, and information design techniques reduced visual ambiguity and made complex content scannable. Photographic imagery was used as objective content rather than decoration, subordinated to typography and layout rules that enabled reproducible design for commissioning institutions and corporations.</p>

      <p class="card-meta confusion">
        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Bauhaus because Swiss Style codified grid-based typography and an objective information design approach distinct from Bauhaus’s broader art-school pedagogy.

    <!-- Card 3: Reaction (choose New Wave OR Grunge) -->
    <article class="curator-card">
      <h2>New Wave Typography</h2>
      <p class="date-range">1970s–1980s</p>
      <div class="card-body">
        <p>The New Wave Typography movement emerged as a reaction to the Swiss approach, privileging expressive manipulation of type and layout over strict grid order. Designers such as Wolfgang Weingart experimented with broken grid, layered typography, experimental spacing and deliberate distortions that sometimes produced anti‑legibility (intentional reduction of easy letter recognition) for emphasis. Visually it features uneven baselines, overlapping images and type, mixed weights, and collage-like compositions that foreground rhythm and texture. The movement influenced editorial and poster practices, expanded the expressive role of type, and influenced subsequent print and digital experimentation in layout and typography.</p>

        <strong>Not to be confused with</strong> Swiss Style, because New Wave deliberately disrupts the strict Swiss grid order and foregrounds expressive spacing and layered typography.
