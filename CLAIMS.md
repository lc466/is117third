## Card 1: Bauhaus

### Claim 1
- **Claim:** Bauhaus was founded in **1919** and was shut down in **1933**.
- **Source link(s):**
  - MoMA exhibition page (“Bauhaus 1919–1933: Workshops for Modernity”) — https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/303
  - Encyclopaedia Britannica (“Bauhaus… existed in Germany from 1919 to 1933”) — https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bauhaus
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** Both sources explicitly state the 1919–1933 timeframe; MoMA also mentions closure by the Nazis.

## Card 2: Swiss Style

### Claim 1
- **Claim:** Swiss Style is **also referred to as the International Typographic Style**, and is associated with **grid-based design** and **asymmetrical layouts**.
- **Source link(s):**
  - Cooper Hewitt blog post (“A Harmony of Contrasts”) — https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2018/08/05/aharmonyofcontrasts/
- **Confidence:** High
- **Notes:** The Cooper Hewitt post directly uses “also referred to as the International Typographic Style” and lists grid-based design + asymmetry as features.

## Card 3: New Wave Typography

### Claim 1
- **Claim:** Wolfgang Weingart is associated with breaking the established rules of Swiss typography, including **freeing type from strict grid-based design**, and his approach is linked to postmodern “New Wave.”
- **Source link(s):**
  - Muthesius Kunsthochschule PDF (“Wolfgang Weingart: Revolutionising Modern Swiss Typography”) — https://www.muthesius-kunsthochschule.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2018/10/finished-outcome.pdf
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Notes:** The PDF explicitly describes Weingart breaking with established rules and “freeing letters from the shackles of the design grid,” and connects this to postmodern “New Wave.” For a High confidence claim, I may add a second source (e.g., museum/archival essay or book excerpt) to corroborate the “New Wave” label.

## Reflection

**One AI claim I didn't trust at first and how I verified it:**

The AI asserted that “Swiss Style is also called the International Typographic Style” and that it relies on grid-based, asymmetrical layouts. I worried this might be a sloppy synonym or an oversimplification, so I checked a museum-quality source. The Cooper Hewitt article explicitly uses that alternate name and lists grid-based design and asymmetry as features, so I kept the claim.
