## WHAT I ALREADY KNOW (OR THINK I KNOW)

```
Write bluntly. Wrong answers are fine. That is the point.
```

1.  Bauhaus = a German school/movement that tried to unify art, craft, and industrial production; “modernist” look (functional + geometric) is often associated with it.
2.  Swiss Style = “International Typographic Style”; strong grids, asymmetry, typographic hierarchy; aims for clarity and neutrality (often feels “rational”).
3.  Reaction to Swiss: New Wave / Grunge both push back against strict modernist rules; they introduce experimentation and more personal/expressive typography (but in different ways).

## WHAT I DO NOT KNOW

```
What are you fuzzy on? What might be completely wrong?
Be honest. Uncertainty is data.
```

1.  Which “core principles” are most accurate to claim as Bauhaus (e.g., is “form follows function” truly a Bauhaus framing, or broader modernism)? VERIFY
2.  Whether describing Swiss Style as “objective photography + neutrality” is an oversimplification; what wording is most precise (information design? corporate identity? systematic typography)? VERIFY
3.  The boundary between New Wave vs Grunge: is New Wave mainly “warping the grid from inside Swiss modernism,” while Grunge is more anti-legibility + texture/noise + vernacular culture? VERIFY

## VOCABULARY I NEED BEFORE I CAN WRITE

```
List the domain terms you need to learn.
If you cannot define it in one sentence, you do not know it yet.
```

1.  Grid system — an underlying alignment structure (columns/rows/modules) that organizes layout and information.
2.  Typographic hierarchy — using size/weight/spacing/position to signal importance and guide reading order.
3.  Asymmetrical layout — non-centered composition that still achieves balance, often via grid alignment (Swiss).
4.  Legibility vs readability — letterform recognizability (legibility) vs ease of continuous reading (readability).
5.  Vorkurs — Bauhaus “preliminary course” foundation training (form/material/color); details and wording VERIFY.
6.  International Typographic Style — relationship to “Swiss Style” and scope (synonym or nuance?) VERIFY.
7.  Distressed typography / vernacular — terms often used for Grunge/anti-clean aesthetics; appropriateness VERIFY.

Bauhaus (1919–1933)
  • What it is: school + movement; integration of art/craft/industry (VERIFY phrasing)
  • Core goals: unified design disciplines; functional modern forms; education model (Vorkurs) (VERIFY)
  • Visual cues: geometric abstraction, simplified forms, sans-serif type, modular compositions (VERIFY)
  • Outputs/media: architecture, furniture, product design, posters, typography
  • Influence: modernist design education + industrial aesthetics

Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (1950s–1970s)
  • What it is: typographic approach/system; international modernist graphic design language
  • Core goals: clarity, order, neutrality; information-first communication
  • Visual cues: grid system, asymmetry, typographic hierarchy, negative space, sans-serif, “objective photography” (VERIFY nuance)
  • Outputs/media: posters, corporate identity systems, signage, editorial design
  • Influence: corporate modernism, information design conventions, UI/layout thinking

Reaction (New Wave OR Grunge)
  • What it is: reaction against strict modernist rules; more expression/experimentation
  • New Wave: typographic experimentation (layering/spacing/breaking grid) while still referencing structure (VERIFY)
  • Grunge: distressed type, collage/noise/texture; embraces imperfection and anti-legibility (VERIFY)
  • Outcomes: expanded typographic expression; loosened rules; “rule-breaking becomes a style”


## PINNED: VOCABULARY

```

Bauhaus (candidates)
  • geometric abstraction
  • functionalism (VERIFY if best label)
  • sans-serif typography
  • primary colors (VERIFY)
  • modularity / modular composition
  • Vorkurs (VERIFY)

Swiss Style (candidates)
  • grid system
  • asymmetry

  • negative space
  • International Typographic Style
  • objective photography (VERIFY, might replace with “photography + type integration”)

Reaction — New Wave (candidates)
  • broken grid
  • layered typography
  • experimental spacing
  • typographic play (possible replacement)
  • deconstruction (VERIFY if appropriate here)
  • rule-breaking (might be too vague; possibly replace)

Reaction — Grunge (candidates)
  • distressed typography
  • anti-legibility
  • collage
  • texture/noise
  • vernacular (VERIFY)
  • DIY aesthetics (borderline as “domain term”; VERIFY)


## PINNED: CONFUSIONS AND BOUNDARIES

```
Source: AI-generated via Prompt Pack > Confusions prompt.
Pin the distinctions that surprised you or corrected you.
```

1.  Bauhaus vs Swiss Style
  • Both are “modern,” but Bauhaus is a school/movement spanning multiple disciplines (education + products + architecture), while Swiss Style is a graphic design/typography system centered on grid + information clarity. (VERIFY phrasing)
2.  Swiss Style vs Bauhaus typography
  • Swiss Style is more systematic about grid/hierarchy/neutrality; Bauhaus typography can be modern, but it is not synonymous with the later “International Typographic Style.” (VERIFY)
3.  New Wave vs Grunge
  • New Wave often reads as typographic experimentation (layering/spacing/breaking grid) that still “talks to” modernist structure; Grunge more strongly embraces distress, texture/noise, collage, and anti-legibility with a more vernacular/anti-clean attitude. (VERIFY)
4.  Legibility vs readability
  • New Wave may strain readability while keeping letterforms recognizable; Grunge can intentionally damage both readability and legibility. (VERIFY)

## DECISIONS

| Decision | Your Answer |
|---|---|
| Card 3 movement | New Wave Typography — it feels like a clearer “reaction to Swiss” (breaking/warping the grid from within typographic modernism) and is easier to draw precise boundaries without drifting into broader cultural claims.|
| Expert for critique | Wolfgang Weingart — a central figure associated with New Wave, and a credible “internal critic” of Swiss modernist orthodoxy (type + grid experimentation).|

## THINGS I CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT

```
After research, what did you reverse on? If nothing, you were not
paying attention or you already knew everything. Pick one.
```

1.  I originally treated Bauhaus and Swiss Style as basically the same “modern typography,” but now I see Swiss Style as a replicable typographic system, while Bauhaus is an education + cross-media design program (not the same level of “style”). (VERIFY wording)
2.  I initially assumed “reaction to Swiss” meant “throw away the grid,” but it seems more like New Wave distorts/breaks the grid while still responding to it, rather than being purely unstructured (Grunge pushes further toward noise/anti-legibility). (VERIFY)
