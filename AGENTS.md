# AGENTS.md — AI Instructions

> This file is my “master letter” to you (the AI). Follow it for every output in this project.
> If any fact is uncertain, write **VERIFY** rather than guessing.

## Audience & Tone

- **Audience:** Museum visitors with general interest in design (not experts)
- **Tone:** Authoritative but accessible. Museum wall-label style — precise, confident, no fluff.
- **Reading level:** Educated adult. Avoid jargon unless briefly contextualized.

## Project Goal

Create **3 Curator Cards** for a one-page static website:
1) **Bauhaus (1919–1933)**
2) **Swiss Style / International Typographic Style (1950s–1970s)**
3) **Reaction to Swiss: New Wave Typography** (fixed)

Cards should explain what the movement is, how it looks (observable traits), and why it matters, in a way that a museum visitor can understand quickly.

## Hard Constraints (Non-negotiable)

For **each** card:

- **Word count (body paragraph only):** 80–120 words  
  - Count ONLY the body paragraph. Headings/tags/links/notes do not count.
- **Number of cards total:** exactly 3
- **Vocabulary tags:** exactly 5
- **Example links:** exactly 2 (must be real, working URLs)
- **Required sentences (must appear exactly once each):**
  - `Not to be confused with ___ because ___.`
  - `Accountability: I verified this by checking [source].`

## Banned Words

Do not use these vague words:

- creative, innovative, revolutionary, iconic
- interesting, unique, beautiful, amazing
- game-changing, groundbreaking, cutting-edge
- basically, essentially, literally

Replace with specific, observable design vocabulary.

## Controlled Vocabulary (Use these terms; define any others before using)

Use the following terms whenever relevant. If you must use a term not listed here, define it in one short clause the first time.

| Term                            | Definition                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bauhaus                         | German school and movement linking art, craft, and industrial production (VERIFY phrasing per source). |
| Vorkurs                         | Bauhaus preliminary course focused on fundamentals of form, materials, and color (VERIFY details). |
| functionalism                   | Emphasis on purpose/use shaping design decisions; avoid treating as a slogan unless sourced. |
| geometric abstraction           | Use of simplified geometric forms rather than representational imagery. |
| modularity                      | Building compositions or objects from repeatable units/modules. |
| sans-serif                      | Typefaces without finishing strokes; often used for modern clarity. |
| primary colors                  | Red/yellow/blue as a simplified palette; use only if supported by sources (VERIFY). |
| typography                      | Arrangement of type to communicate information (size, weight, spacing, layout). |
| grid system                     | Underlying alignment structure (columns/rows/modules) organizing layout. |
| asymmetry                       | Balanced composition without mirror symmetry; often aligned to a grid. |
| typographic hierarchy           | Visual ranking of text elements using size/weight/spacing/position. |
| negative space                  | Intentional empty space shaping composition and readability. |
| alignment                       | Consistent positioning of elements along shared edges/axes.  |
| information design              | Structuring content for clear, efficient understanding (charts/signage/layout). |
| International Typographic Style | Swiss Style label associated with systematic typography (VERIFY equivalence/scope). |
| objective tone                  | Preference for neutral, information-first presentation; avoid overclaiming (VERIFY). |
| photography + type integration  | Using photography as content while maintaining typographic structure and hierarchy. |
| corporate identity              | Coherent visual system for an organization (logo, type, layout, rules). |
| legibility                      | How easily individual letters are distinguished.             |
| readability                     | How easily continuous text can be read and followed.         |
| New Wave Typography             | Post-Swiss typographic approach emphasizing experimentation while referencing structure (VERIFY dates). |
| broken grid                     | Deliberate disruption or warping of strict grid alignment.   |
| layered typography              | Stacking/overlapping type to create density, rhythm, or ambiguity. |
| experimental spacing            | Unconventional kerning/leading/placement to alter reading and emphasis. |
| anti-legibility                 | Intentional reduction of easy letter recognition for expressive effect (use carefully). |

*Target: 15–25 terms. Keep this list tight and actually used in the cards.*

## Verification Rule (Critical)

- If you are unsure about any fact, date, attribution, or claim: write **VERIFY** instead of guessing.
- Do not invent quotes.
- Do not fabricate anecdotes.
- Do not attribute ideas to people without sourced evidence.
- Example links must be from credible museums/archives/university collections when possible.

## Output Format (Must follow exactly)

When asked to generate cards, output **exactly** the following structure for each card, in this order:

[MOVEMENT] ([DATE RANGE])

[ONE body paragraph, 80–120 words]

Tags: tag1 · tag2 · tag3 · tag4 · tag5

Examples: Title — Institution (URL) · Title — Institution (URL)

Not to be confused with X, because Y.

Accountability: I verified this by checking SOURCE.

## Self-Check Before You Output (Do this silently)

- Body paragraph word count is 80–120.
- Exactly 5 tags, all are domain terms (no vibe adjectives).
- Exactly 2 URLs, likely credible and real.
- Includes exactly one confusion sentence (checkable distinction, not vague).
- Includes exactly one accountability sentence naming a specific source.
- No banned words.
- No hedging (“probably/maybe”) unless paired with **VERIFY**.
